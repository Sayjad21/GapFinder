| Claim | Label | Gap before | Gap after | Noise band | Explained by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 (mean_reward) | Paper-artifact inconsistency | +33.2% | +0.1% | ±16.2% | `lr_schedule=inv` |

## C1: mean_reward (paper 139.35)
**Paper-artifact inconsistency** · gap +33.2% → +0.1% · 2 hypotheses tested
> Confirmed cause: reverting it brings the gap back, held-out claims hold, and the value has evidence

### Which experiment changed it?
- Branch: `B0006`, `B0008`, `B0009`, `B0010`, `B0011`, `B0012` (6 run(s) of the same config)
- Config: `lr_schedule` naive `const`, changed to `inv`
- Command:

  Replay: fork checkpoint `92d7c7ba-05ed-4248-b0a7-c92940d37641` and run
  ```
  RUN_TAG=a44e64ff83dd "${PYTHON:-python3}" cartpole_q.py --episodes 400 --gamma 0.99 --lr 0.1 --lr_schedule inv --eps_start 1.0 --eps_end 0.05 --eps_decay 0.99 --theta_bins 6 --omega_bins 6 --reward_norm off --max_steps 200 --init_q 0.0 --seeds 10 --eval_episodes 20 --out out/result.json
  ```
- Output: `mean_reward` 140.9, 113.8, 138.2, 161.8, 145.1, 133.2; gap after +0.1%; result checkpoint `c21812d8-8b7c-4a9b-85ae-927a998bdecc`
- Effect: candidate 139.6 minus naive 185.5 = -45.99, 95% bootstrap interval [-62.62, -19.33] (6 candidate runs vs 5 naive runs)

### What did the paper report?
> A tabular Q-learner over six pole-angle and six angular-velocity bins balances CartPole for a mean of 139.3 steps after 400 training episodes.

- p. 1; value used: `mean_reward` = 139.35 steps (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 185.5 over 5 runs; repeats: 196.9, 185.5, 167.7, 190.1, 157.1
- Spread: range 157.1 to 196.9, noise band ±22.64 (2 x MAD), CV 9.2%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: +33.2% (noise band ±16.2% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- PASS · Counterfactual (reversal test): without `lr_schedule` the gap is +33.2% (it comes back)
- PASS · Held-out claim: C2: +164.0% to +23.9% (not worse beyond noise)
- PASS · Evidence: `lr_schedule=inv`: paper states 'inv (0.1 / (1 + t/50))'
- PASS · Effect vs noise: candidate minus naive is -45.99 with a 95% bootstrap interval that excludes 0

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `discretise_theta_range`, `discretise_omega_range`, `cartpole_g`, `cartpole_dt`, `reset_uniform_range`, `cartpole_mc`, `cartpole_mp`, `cartpole_l`, `cartpole_f`, `RUN_TAG`, `greedy_evaluation_policy`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): none
- Near alternatives (closest across all claims):
  - `lr_schedule=linear`: this claim +15.6%, mean |gap| 195.7% (6 runs)

### History matching (every measured configuration, all claims together)
- 2 of 2 tested configurations fit every claim within 3 sigma
- Not ruled out (all claims within 3 sigma): 2 configurations
  - `lr_schedule`: lr_schedule=inv (max I 0.55); lr_schedule=linear (max I 2.16)
- Equally good values: `lr_schedule` in {inv, linear}

Notes:
- equally good values within one noise band (measured): lr_schedule in {inv, linear}

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lr_schedule=inv` | 6 | +0.1% | +23.9% | 12.0% |
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | +33.2% | +164.0% | 98.6% |
| `lr_schedule=linear` | 6 | +15.6% | +375.7% | 195.7% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `discretise_theta_range`, `discretise_omega_range`, `cartpole_g`, `cartpole_dt`, `reset_uniform_range`, `cartpole_mc`, `cartpole_mp`, `cartpole_l`, `cartpole_f`, `RUN_TAG`, `greedy_evaluation_policy`
