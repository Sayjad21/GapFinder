| Claim | Label | Gap before | Gap after | Noise band | Explained by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 (mean_reward) | Fits but unsupported | +73.3% | +26.9% | ±14.0% | `lr_schedule=inv` |

## C1: mean_reward (paper 98.685)
**Fits but unsupported** · gap +73.3% → +26.9% · 2 hypotheses tested
> Plausible explanation (fits but unsupported): it fits the number, but nothing says the authors used it

### Which experiment changed it?
- Branch: `B0007`, `B0008`, `B0009`, `B0010`, `B0011`, `B0012` (6 run(s) of the same config)
- Config: `lr_schedule` naive `const`, changed to `inv`
- Command:

  Replay: fork checkpoint `9961030b-5379-4917-821d-74979f1f4e25` and run
  ```
  RUN_TAG=28f1feb7b34b "${PYTHON:-python3}" cartpole_q.py --episodes 400 --gamma 0.99 --lr 0.1 --lr_schedule inv --eps_start 1.0 --eps_end 0.05 --eps_decay 0.99 --theta_bins 6 --omega_bins 6 --reward_norm off --init_q 0.0 --seeds 10 --eval_episodes 20 --out out/result.json
  ```
- Output: `mean_reward` 97.41, 107.9, 153.8, 120.1, 138.2, 130.4; gap after +26.9%; result checkpoint `beeac2a8-b8bd-46e1-a632-80e5a07a12ce`
- Effect: candidate 125.2 minus naive 171 = -45.81, 95% bootstrap interval [-60.66, -28.72] (6 candidate runs vs 5 naive runs)

### What did the paper report?
> A tabular Q-learner over a coarse state grid reaches a mean reward of 98.7 on CartPole; the worst of its seeds reaches 95.4.

- p. 1; value used: `mean_reward` = 98.685 reward (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 171 over 5 runs; repeats: 177.9, 171, 163.7, 187.4, 170.4
- Spread: range 163.7 to 187.4, noise band ±13.77 (2 x MAD), CV 5.2%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: +73.3% (noise band ±14.0% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- PASS · Counterfactual (reversal test): without `lr_schedule` the gap is +73.3% (it comes back)
- PASS · Held-out claim: C2: -41.1% to -59.4% (not worse beyond noise)
- FAIL · Evidence: `lr_schedule=inv`: no evidence mentions 'inv'; it fits, but nothing says the authors used it
- PASS · Effect vs noise: candidate minus naive is -45.81 with a 95% bootstrap interval that excludes 0

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `--max_steps`, `RUN_TAG`, `RL_SEED_BASE`, `--out`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): none
- Near alternatives: none recorded

### History matching (every measured configuration, all claims together)
- out-of-space likely: no tested configuration comes within 3 sigma of C1, among 2 tested

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lr_schedule=inv` | 6 | +26.9% | -59.4% | 43.2% |
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | +73.3% | -41.1% | 57.2% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `--max_steps`, `RUN_TAG`, `RL_SEED_BASE`, `--out`
