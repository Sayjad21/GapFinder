| Claim | Label | Gap before | Gap after | Noise band | Explained by |

## Audit of the reproduction
What a matching number doesn't show. The protocol tests below were run; the rest is static.
- **Found, but the test failed**: `data_provider/data_factory.py:19` `drop_last = True` is fixed in the evaluation branch: it drops the last incomplete batch, so part of the evaluation data is never scored and the metric depends on the batch size; with it switched off the program didn't finish (protocol test | no metrics parsed from output: ''). The code may assume it.

## C_h2_336: etth2_336_mse (paper 0.311)
**Reproduced**: naive gap -0.1% is inside the noise band ±1.0%.

### Which experiment changed it?
- None was needed: the naive run is inside the noise band of the paper's value.

### What did the paper report?
- Quote not recorded (the report has no linked ledger claim); the value used was `etth2_336_mse` = 0.311.

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 0.3107 over 5 runs; repeats: 0.3107, 0.3107, 0.3107, 0.3107, 0.3107
- Spread: range 0.3107 to 0.3107, noise band ±0.003107 (2 x MAD), CV 0.0%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: -0.1% (noise band ±1.0% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- nothing to verify: no explanation was proposed

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: none
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): none
- Near alternatives: none recorded

Notes:
- naive run is within the noise band of the paper's value

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C_h2_336 | C_h2_96 | C_h2_192 | C_h2_720 | C_h1_96 | C_h1_192 | C_h1_336 | C_h1_720 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | -0.1% | -0.1% | +0.1% | +0.2% | -0.0% | -0.0% | +0.0% | -0.1% | 0.1% |

## Knob names
- Code defaults read from the code instead of the ledger: `seq_len` 96 at run_longExp.py:27 (ledger said 720), `train_epochs` 100 at run_longExp.py:72 (ledger said 30), `patience` 100 at run_longExp.py:74 (ledger said 5), `itr` 2 at run_longExp.py:71 (ledger said 1), `batch_size` 128 at run_longExp.py:73 (ledger said 256), `lradj` 'type3' at run_longExp.py:78 (ledger said type3), `loss` 'mse' at run_longExp.py:77 (ledger said mse), `embed` 'learned' at run_longExp.py:63 (ledger said learned)

## Runtime trace (one dry run)
9 process(es) traced. Each role comes from the sink the knob's value reached, not from its name.
- `train_epochs`: size (width.out_features (Linear) at models/SparseTSF.py:21)
