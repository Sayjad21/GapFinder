## C1: mean_reward (paper 59.35)
**Unexplained** · gap +219.8% → +219.8% · 2 hypotheses tested

### Which experiment changed it?
- None: no tested change moved the gap (2 hypotheses tested).

### What did the paper report?
> A tabular Q-learner over a coarse state grid reaches a mean reward of 59.4 on CartPole; the worst of its seeds reaches 9.8.

- p. 1; value used: `mean_reward` = 59.35 reward (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 189.8 over 5 runs; repeats: 192.7, 200, 167.3, 189.8, 185.7
- Spread: range 167.3 to 200, noise band ±8.12 (2 x MAD), CV 6.5%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: +219.8% (noise band ±13.7% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- nothing to verify: no explanation was proposed

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `--eps_start`, `RUN_TAG`, `RL_SEED_BASE`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): `lr_schedule=inv` (6.31 noise units, gap +133.5%); `lr_schedule=linear` (3.75 noise units, gap +168.5%)
- Near alternatives (closest across all claims):
  - `lr_schedule=inv`: this claim +131.2%, mean |gap| 226.6% (6 runs)
  - `lr_schedule=linear`: this claim +177.9%, mean |gap| 737.8% (6 runs)

### History matching (every measured configuration, all claims together)
- out-of-space likely: no tested configuration comes within 3 sigma of C1, among 2 tested

Notes:
- closest configuration tried: {'lr_schedule': 'inv'} (gap +131.2%); it did not pass verification
- history matching: out-of-space likely: no tested configuration comes within 3 sigma of C1, among 2 tested

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lr_schedule=inv` | 6 | +131.2% | +322.1% | 226.6% |
| `lr_schedule=linear` | 6 | +177.9% | +1297.7% | 737.8% |
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | +219.8% | +1318.3% | 769.0% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `--eps_start`, `RUN_TAG`, `RL_SEED_BASE`
