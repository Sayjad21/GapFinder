## C1: test_accuracy (paper 0.7069)
**Unexplained** · gap -31.0% → -31.0% · 13 hypotheses tested

### Which experiment changed it?
- None: no tested change moved the gap (13 hypotheses tested).

### What did the paper report?
> We revisit logistic regression trained with mini-batch SGD on a synthetic screening dataset and show that it reaches 0.707 test accuracy.

- p. 1; value used: `test_accuracy` = 0.7069 (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 0.4875 over 5 runs; repeats: 0.4667, 0.475, 0.55, 0.4875, 0.5333
- Spread: range 0.4667 to 0.55, noise band ±0.0416 (2 x MAD), CV 7.4%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: -31.0% (noise band ±5.9% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- nothing to verify: no explanation was proposed

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `RUN_TAG`, `aggregation`, `SCALES`, `WEIGHTS`, `num_runs`, `weight_init_std`, `sigmoid_clamp`, `CPU`, `OS`, `Python_version`, `random_module`, `floating_point_precision`, `--out`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): `lr_schedule=cosine` (3.5 noise units, gap -10.4%); `normalize=minmax` (2.6 noise units, gap -15.7%); `normalize=zscore` (2.44 noise units, gap +16.7%); `lr_schedule=step` (1.4 noise units, gap -22.8%); `class_weight=balanced` (1.2 noise units, gap -24.0%)
- Near alternatives (closest across all claims):
  - `normalize=minmax`: this claim -15.7%, mean |gap| 18.7% (6 runs)
  - `normalize=minmax`, `lr_schedule=cosine`: this claim -15.7%, mean |gap| 18.7% (5 runs)
  - `normalize=minmax`, `lr_schedule=step`: this claim -15.7%, mean |gap| 18.7% (5 runs)

Notes:
- {'normalize': 'minmax', 'class_weight': 'balanced'} closes this claim but makes held-out claims worse; rejected
- closest configuration tried: {'normalize': 'minmax', 'class_weight': 'balanced'} (gap +8.5%); it did not pass verification

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `normalize=minmax` | 6 | -15.7% | +21.6% | 18.7% |
| `normalize=minmax`, `lr_schedule=cosine` | 5 | -15.7% | +21.6% | 18.7% |
| `normalize=minmax`, `lr_schedule=step` | 5 | -15.7% | +21.6% | 18.7% |
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | -31.0% | +17.2% | 24.1% |
| `lr_schedule=step` | 6 | -27.8% | +23.4% | 25.6% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `RUN_TAG`, `aggregation`, `SCALES`, `WEIGHTS`, `num_runs`, `weight_init_std`, `sigmoid_clamp`, `CPU`, `OS`, `Python_version`, `random_module`, `floating_point_precision`, `--out`
