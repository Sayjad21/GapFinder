| Claim | Label | Gap before | Gap after | Noise band | Explained by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 (mean_reward) | Paper-artifact inconsistency | +32.8% | -8.4% | ±7.2% | `lr_schedule=inv` |

## C1: mean_reward (paper 139.35)
**Paper-artifact inconsistency** · gap +32.8% → -8.4% · 2 hypotheses tested
> Confirmed cause: reverting it brings the gap back, held-out claims hold, and the value has evidence

### Which experiment changed it?
- Branch: `B0006`, `B0008`, `B0009`, `B0010`, `B0011`, `B0012` (6 run(s) of the same config)
- Config: `lr_schedule` naive `const`, changed to `inv`
- Command:

  Replay: fork checkpoint `cebb0235-0009-4ebb-aed7-4cd71bbc9f57` and run
  ```
  RUN_TAG=437e34a3e520 "${PYTHON:-python3}" cartpole_q.py --episodes 400 --gamma 0.99 --lr 0.1 --lr_schedule inv --eps_start 1.0 --eps_end 0.05 --eps_decay 0.99 --theta_bins 6 --omega_bins 6 --reward_norm off --max_steps 200 --init_q 0.0 --seeds 10 --eval_episodes 20 --out out/result.json
  ```
- Output: `mean_reward` 109.2, 124.8, 130.4, 135.8, 141.1, 121.3; gap after -8.4%; result checkpoint `a7bc0bab-db08-49bb-970a-036c4ea774ce`
- Effect: candidate 127.6 minus naive 185.1 = -57.47, 95% bootstrap interval [-62.93, -39.87] (6 candidate runs vs 5 naive runs)

### What did the paper report?
> A tabular Q-learner over six pole-angle and six angular-velocity bins balances CartPole for a mean of 139.3 steps after 400 training episodes.

- p. 1; value used: `mean_reward` = 139.35 steps (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 185.1 over 5 runs; repeats: 166.3, 180.1, 185.1, 188.1, 192.6
- Spread: range 166.3 to 192.6, noise band ±10.04 (2 x MAD), CV 5.5%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: +32.8% (noise band ±7.2% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- PASS · Counterfactual (reversal test): without `lr_schedule` the gap is +32.8% (it comes back)
- PASS · Held-out claim: C2: +356.1% to +9.6% (not worse beyond noise)
- PASS · Evidence: `lr_schedule=inv`: paper states 'inv (0.1 / (1 + t/50))'
- PASS · Effect vs noise: candidate minus naive is -57.47 with a 95% bootstrap interval that excludes 0

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `discretise_theta_range`, `discretise_omega_range`, `cartpole_g`, `cartpole_dt`, `reset_uniform_range`, `cartpole_mc`, `cartpole_mp`, `cartpole_l`, `cartpole_f`, `RUN_TAG`, `greedy_evaluation_policy`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): `lr_schedule=linear` (1.47 noise units, gap +22.2%)
- Near alternatives (closest across all claims):
  - `lr_schedule=linear`: this claim +21.8%, mean |gap| 197.6% (6 runs)

### History matching (every measured configuration, all claims together)
- 1 of 2 tested configurations fit every claim within 3 sigma

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lr_schedule=inv` | 6 | -8.4% | +9.6% | 9.0% |
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | +32.8% | +356.1% | 194.5% |
| `lr_schedule=linear` | 6 | +21.8% | +373.4% | 197.6% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `discretise_theta_range`, `discretise_omega_range`, `cartpole_g`, `cartpole_dt`, `reset_uniform_range`, `cartpole_mc`, `cartpole_mp`, `cartpole_l`, `cartpole_f`, `RUN_TAG`, `greedy_evaluation_policy`
