| Claim | Label | Gap before | Gap after | Noise band | Explained by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 (test_accuracy) | Reproduced | +0.3% | n/a | ±9.3% | — |

## C1: test_accuracy (paper 0.5361)
**Reproduced**: naive gap +0.3% is inside the noise band ±9.3%.

### Which experiment changed it?
- None was needed: the naive run is inside the noise band of the paper's value.

### What did the paper report?
> A plain logistic-regression baseline reaches 0.536 test accuracy and 0.543 balanced accuracy on a synthetic screening task.

- p. 1; value used: `test_accuracy` = 0.5361 (headline claim)

### What did we measure?
- Naive median 0.5375 over 5 runs; repeats: 0.4875, 0.4917, 0.5375, 0.5625, 0.5542
- Spread: range 0.4875 to 0.5625, noise band ±0.05 (2 x MAD), CV 6.7%
- Setup check: none in this report (the band comes from forks of one setup)
- Discrepancy from the paper: +0.3% (noise band ±9.3% of the paper value)

### Why do we believe it?
- nothing to verify: no explanation was proposed

### What remains unknown?
- Untestable within the budget: none
- Not settable with this harness: `RUN_TAG`, `SCALES`, `WEIGHTS`
- Setup reproducibility: not checked
- Unconfirmed leads (moved the gap in the screen, not part of the explanation): none
- Near alternatives: none recorded

Notes:
- naive run is within the noise band of the paper's value

## Closest configurations across all claims
Not an attribution: the labels above judge one claim at a time and require the held-out claims not to get worse. This table shows which measured changes bring several claims toward the paper together (gap per claim, mean of absolute gaps).

| Configuration | Runs | C1 | C2 | Mean |gap| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| naive (reproduction as run) | 5 | +0.3% | -0.1% | 0.2% |

## Not testable with this harness
Assumptions about knobs the harness spec can't set: `RUN_TAG`, `SCALES`, `WEIGHTS`
